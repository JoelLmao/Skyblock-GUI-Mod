!!!
DO NOT TRADE OR AUCTION ANY ITEM YOU DUPE
!!!

Steps:

(1) Open someone's Profile/Player Viewer (Right Click)

(2) Save the GUI using the mod

(3) Close the Profile/Player Viewer and load the GUI back up

(4) You can also change the Keybind to open the GUI in the settings 

(5) Drag anything you want into your inventory

(6) Make shure to not overdo it!

Potential Fixes:
If your Minecraft crashes or the Mod doesn't show up, take every other mod out of your mods folder except this Mod

Minor Issue is that some mods have the option to see where items originate from which in this case is the GUI but you shouldn't worry about that because it's not really
noticable but you should have some legit items in your Inventory.
I also don't recommend you selling your duped stuff on the AH because of the reason above!
